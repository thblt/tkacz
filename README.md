# Tkacz

Yet another instantiation of my attempts to create a sane reference
manager that could actually *improve* rather than degrade my
bibliography/PDF management workflows. There is nothing usable here
for now, yet a Gitter chat has been created for people interested in
providing suggestions or feedback.

People interested in the project may begin by reading the [design
document](doc/design.org), which is (perpetually) obsolete but may
give a good idea of what Tkacz should be.
